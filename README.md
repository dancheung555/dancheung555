# üí´ About Me:
üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on **anomaly detection** such as Isolation Forests, **LSTMs**, and a maze solver before university starts again.<br>üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on projects including data processing, LLMs, NLP, and any fascinating projects or competitions! <br>ü§ù I‚Äôm looking for help with clustering machine learning such as **K-means** and **KNN**, as well as working with AWS.<br>üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Machine Learning, **Stochastic Processes**, and path-finding/mapping algorithms!<br>üí¨ Ask me about Java, C++, R, or Python. I love studying computer programming and wish to build more projects! You can also ask me about my studies in Hong Kong and my life between the US and Hong Kong!<br>‚ö° Fun facts about me: I enjoy making small games (except I struggle with Frontend), I love making origami and learning Taekwondo! I love studying all kinds of models relating to Time Series, Data Manipulation, and Machine Learning.

I am in my third year at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), and I am looking forward to studying as much as I can every day! I hope to work on more fascinating projects as I progress with studies and life! üòä
